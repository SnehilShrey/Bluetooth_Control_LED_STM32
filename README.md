# Bluetooth_Control_LED_STM32

A simple embedded project that allows LED control via Bluetooth communication using an STM32 microcontroller. The system receives commands from a smartphone through an HC-05 Bluetooth module and toggles the LED accordingly. This project demonstrates UART communication, peripheral interfacing, and basic embedded control using STM32.
